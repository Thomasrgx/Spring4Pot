# Log4Pot

A honeypot for the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228).

## Features

* Listen on various ports for Log4Shell exploitation.
* Detect exploitation in request line and headers.
* Log to file and Azure blob storage.

## Usage

1. Install PIP: `apt install python3-pip`
2. Install Azure: `apt install azure`
3. Install Poetry: `pip3 install poetry`
4. Fetch this GitHub repository `git clone https://github.com/Thomasrgx/Log4Pot.git`
5. Change directory into the local copy with `cd Log4Pot`
6. Install dependencies: `poetry install`
7. Put parameters into log4pot.conf.
8. Run: `poetry run python log4pot.py @log4pot.conf`

Alternatively, you can also run log4pot without external dependencies:
```
$ python log4pot.py @log4pot.conf
```
This will run log4pot without support for logging to Azure blob storage.

## Analyzing Logs with JQ

List payloads from exploitation attempts:
```
select(.type == "exploit") | .payload
```

Decode all base64-encoded payloads from JNDI exploit:
```
select(.type == "exploit" and (.payload | contains("Base64"))) | .payload | sub(".*/Base64/"; "") | sub ("}$"; "") | @base64d
```
